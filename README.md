# 👋 Hello! I'm Aditya

🎓 I'm a second-year Mechanical Engineering student (Batch of 2028), currently studying in Dharwad, Karnataka.  
💻 Alongside my core studies, I've developed a strong interest in **Python programming** and have started building real-world projects to grow as a developer.

I'm self-taught in Python and passionate about:
- Solving problems through code
- Learning step by step
- Exploring software development
- Working toward a peaceful and purpose-driven tech career

I believe in **consistent progress**, and I'm building projects that help me learn better.
Outside of coding, I'm a rhythm guitarist and love performing live — I've performed multiple times at college events, blending creativity with logic in everything I do.
